        <li>cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce, divided </li> 
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided </li>
        <li>4 slices pepperoni, or to taste - divided </li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl; place flour into a second bowl. Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a third bowl.</li>
      <li>Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture and dredge in flour; dip again in egg mixture and dredge chicken in crumb mixture until coated. Place coated chicken breasts into a baking dish..</li> 
      <li>Spoon 2 tablespoons pizza sauce onto each chicken breast, sprinkle each with half the mozzarella cheese, and top each with half the pepperoni slices.
      <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
